The project implements a parser for Age of Empires II recorded game files. It supports different versions of the game, including Age of Kings, The Conquerors, Userpatch 1.4, Userpatch 1.5, HD Edition, and Definitive Edition. The parser can operate in two modes: 'fast' and 'full'. The 'fast' parser skips rarely needed data for speed, while the 'full' parser attempts to parse as much information as possible. Abstractions are also offered to provide easier-to-use data representations. The parsing is performed using Python 3.12.7.
